The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of _30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless Artus uses the ring to end the effect as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.\n\t \n• Artus can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: Bigby\u0027s hand (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), cone of cold (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as flesh to stone except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), ice storm (2 charges), Otiluke\u0027s otiluke\u0027s freezing sphere (3 charges), sleet storm (1 charge), spike growth (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or wall of ice (2 charges).\n\t \n• Artus can expend the necessary number of charges and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can\u0027t have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (Artus\u0027s choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator\u0027s commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Artus. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts.

If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.\n\t \n2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.\n\t \n3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.\n\t \n4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won\u0027t willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.\n\t \n5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn\u0027t immune to.\n\t \n6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn\u0027t use any of its speeds on its turn.\n\t \n7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn\u0027t possible, it continues fighting.\n\t \n8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.\n\t \n9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.\n\t \n10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn\u0027t immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren\u0027t adamantine.",

Nothing of the digested body remains. Any equipment on the corpse is expelled from the corpse flower in its space.\n\t \n• The corpse flower animates one dead humanoid in its body, turning it into a zombie. The zombie appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the corpse flower and acts immediately after it in the initiative order. The zombie acts as an ally of the corpse flower but isn\u0027t under its control, and the flower\u0027s stench clings to it (see the Stench of Death trait).",

The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target\u0027s speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can\u0027t take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or the death tyrant moves it up to 30 ft. in any direction. It is restrained by the ray\u0027s telekinetic grip until the start of the death tyrant\u0027s next turn or until the death tyrant is incapacitated.\nIf the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn\u0027t being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 ft. in any direction. The death tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.\n7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.\n8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.\n9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.\nIf the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.\n10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.",

Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can\u0027t grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature\u0027s existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it.

        "Content": "A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.\n\tA clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork\u0027s builder.\n\t \nd10 — Enhancement:\n\t \n1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn\u0027t already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.\n\t \n2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork\u0027s darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn\u0027t already have it.\n\t \n3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork\u0027s AC increases by 2.\n\t \n4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork\u0027s speed increases by 10 feet.\n\t \n5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.\n\t \n6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn\u0027t function at the start of its next turn.\n\t \n7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork\u0027s hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.\n\t \n8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.\n\t \n9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator\u0027s choice).\n\t \n10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.\n\t \nClockwork Malfunctions:\n\t \nd10 — Malfunction\n\t \n1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.\n\t \n2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.\n\t \n3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.\n\t \n4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won\u0027t willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.\n\t \n5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn\u0027t immune to.\n\t \n6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn\u0027t use any of its speeds on its turn.\n\t \n7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn\u0027t possible, it continues fighting.\n\t \n8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.\n\t \n9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.\n\t \n10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn\u0027t immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren\u0027t adamantine.",

Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the target’s turns.

The kobold throws a clay pot full of green slime at the target, and it breaks open on impact. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: The target is covered in a patch of green slime (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Miss: A patch of green slime covers a randomly determined S-foot-square section of wall or floor within 5 feet of the target.\n\t \n5. Rot Grub Pot.

A swarm of rot grubs (see appendix A) emerges from the shattered pot and remains a hazard in that square.\n\t \n6. Scorpion on a Stick.

Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\t \n7. Skunk in a Cage. The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw.

A creature that doesn’t need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can’t do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.\n\t \n8. Wasp Nest in a Bag. The kobold throws a small bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (wasps) with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative.

Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\nWishes.\nThe genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn\u0027t a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can\u0027t grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature\u0027s existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature\u0027s behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie\u0027s nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish\u0027s poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie\u0027s benefit.",

For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.\n\tA clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork\u0027s builder.\n\t \nd10 — Enhancement:\n\t \n1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn\u0027t already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.\n\t \n2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork\u0027s darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn\u0027t already have it.\n\t \n3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork\u0027s AC increases by 2.\n\t \n4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork\u0027s speed increases by 10 feet.\n\t \n5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.\n\t \n6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn\u0027t function at the start of its next turn.\n\t \n7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork\u0027s hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.\n\t \n8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.\n\t \n9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator\u0027s choice).\n\t \n10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.\n\t \nClockwork Malfunctions:\n\t \nd10 — Malfunction\n\t \n1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.\n\t \n2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.\n\t \n3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.\n\t \n4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won\u0027t willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.\n\t \n5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn\u0027t immune to.\n\t \n6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn\u0027t use any of its speeds on its turn.\n\t \n7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn\u0027t possible, it continues fighting.\n\t \n8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.\n\t \n9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.\n\t \n10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn\u0027t immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren\u0027t adamantine.",

For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.\n\tA clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork\u0027s builder.\n\t \nd10 — Enhancement:\n\t \n1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn\u0027t already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.\n\t \n2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork\u0027s darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn\u0027t already have it.\n\t \n3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork\u0027s AC increases by 2.\n\t \n4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork\u0027s speed increases by 10 feet.\n\t \n5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.\n\t \n6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn\u0027t function at the start of its next turn.\n\t \n7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork\u0027s hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.\n\t \n8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.\n\t \n9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator\u0027s choice).\n\t \n10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.\n\t \nClockwork Malfunctions:\n\t \nd10 — Malfunction\n\t \n1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.\n\t \n2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.\n\t \n3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.\n\t \n4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won\u0027t willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.\n\t \n5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn\u0027t immune to.\n\t \n6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn\u0027t use any of its speeds on its turn.\n\t \n7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn\u0027t possible, it continues fighting.\n\t \n8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork\u0027s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.\n\t \n9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.\n\t \n10 — Weak Armor.
